## Why we do what we do

In bayesian statistics we use probability distributions to measure uncertainty about the parameter values we care about. 

Because we measure uncertainty with probability, that means we work in probability distributions. 
We begin with distributions, and we end with distributions.
The beginning distributions express all we want to say about what our parameters are. 
They come first, and are called the "prior" distributions.
After we collect data and apply some model to relate it, we find ourselves with a new set of distributions. 
Because these come *after* the process of data collection and model creation, this is called the "posterior".

This means we are applying Bayes rule. This shows us how to update our priors to reflect what we learned from the experiment and model building:

$$
\begin{align}
[\theta_1, \theta_2 | \bf y] &\propto [\theta_1, \theta_2, \bf y] \\
&\propto  [\bf y | \theta_1, \theta_2][\theta_1][\theta_2] \\
\end{align}
$$


<div class = "blue">

Refreshing questions: 

* which of these is the likelihood? Which is the prior? 
* why is it OK to use something _proportional to_ ($\propto$) what we want?

</div>

The whole goal here is to get this posterior distribution. There are many ways to do this! 
This workshop is about some of them.

* **Conjugate priors** -- works for 1-parameter problems. Gives you the literal equation of the posterior distribution. Only directly useful for very simple problems. Becomes the absolute star of the show with Gibbs Sampling.
* **Laplace Approximation** -- very handy, useful best guess for many multi-parameter models; we're not doing it. 
* **Metropolis** -- A venerable classic for sampling simple models. You have to propose random "jumps" around the distribution, and these need to be symmetric
* **Metropolis-Hastings** -- same as Metropolis, but the jumps get to be _asymmetric_.
* **Gibbs sampling** -- A wonderful technique for simplifying complex problems. Requires that priors be chosen to make conjugate pairs with likelihoods. 
* **Metropolis-in-Gibbs** -- is a Deluxe Combo of the previous two. 
* **HMC etc** -- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is an advanced modern way of doing the same thing. Sets you free to use the priors that work for your question, not the ones that work for your math.

# MCMC in general

The objective of MCMC algorithm is to sample parameters from a complex posterior distribution.

Rather than measure the *absolute* probability of different parameter values:

$$
[\theta|y] = \frac{[y|\theta][\theta]}{[y]}
$$

we sample, and evaluate the *relative* probability of two possible parameter values:

$$
\frac{[\theta^{new}|y]}{[\theta^k|y]} = \frac{[y|\theta^{new}][\theta^{new}]}{[y|\theta^k][\theta^k]}
$$

In this way, we can sample a probability distribution ( $[\theta|y]$ ) using only something _proportional_ to that distribution ( $[y|\theta][\theta]$ ). Put another way, we can't get an equation, so we use interesting numerical tricks to jump straight to a histogram. 

## The Metropolis Algorithm

**STEP 1** Draw $\theta^{new}$ from a _symmetric_ distribution centered on $\theta^{k}$ (i.e. in the $k$th interation, the current value)
e.g. $\theta^{new} \sim N(\theta^{k}, \sigma_{tune})$

**STEP 2** Calculate the ratio R:

$$
R = \text{min}\left( 1, \frac{[y|\theta^{new}][\theta^{new}]}{[y|\theta^k][\theta^k]}\right)
$$

This is the probability of acceptance. In other words, if the ratio is greater than one, that means the proposal is for a more probable value. We'll always take it. 
If the ratio is less than 1, that means the new proposal is less probable than the value we have already. However, there's a chance we'll take it anyway.

**STEP 3** Test to see if `runif(1, min=0, max=1)` $< R$. if so, set $\theta^{k + 1} = \theta^{new}$

Why should we accept "worse" parameter values? Why is it good to sometimes stay in the same place?

### Metropolis demo: the mean of the Normal Distribution

Let's simulate some data from a normal distribution. 

```{r}
set.seed(1859)
M_true_mean <- 50
correct_sd <- 3
weights <- rnorm(300, mean = M_true_mean, sd = correct_sd)

head(weights)
```
  

One possible model for these data could be:  
  
$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu, 3) \\
\mu &\sim \text{Normal(40, 10)}
\end{align}
$$
  
**NOTE:** We **assume we KNOW the standard deviation**. In this case, it is exactly 3. 
This is just for illustration.  Later we will see what to do if you have multiple parameters.
  

To set up a Metropolis sampler, we'll start by defining four useful functions: 

1. A function which returns the _log-likelihood_ of our data. As you recall, the likelihood of one datapoint is the probability of sampling that datapoint from a distribution, given specific known parameters.  The likelihood of the data is the probability of observing ALL the datapoints. We assume the observations are independent, so we multiply the probability of each datapoint to get the probability of the whole dataset. Because we're working on the log scale, instead of multiplication we just use addition.
1. a proposal function. This makes new values to try at each iteration of the Markov Chain. Here we'll use a symmetric proposal function, the uniform distribution.
1. A convenience function to add the log-likelihood and the prior together -- this gives us the numerator of the Bayes formula. 
1. finally, a function which puts it all together and spits out the probability of acceptance. Because this is a probability, we use `exp()` to convert from log-likelihood values back to probability. 

```{r}

## define likelihoods for our problem
MEAN_normal_loglike <- function(data_vec, mean_value){
  sum(dnorm(data_vec, mean = mean_value, sd = 3, log = TRUE))
}

# proposal function to make new parameter values.
M_propose_new_val <- function(old_value, tune) {
  runif(1, min = old_value - tune, max = old_value + tune)
}

## function to use these to calculate the value of the numerator in Bayes Formula
## We are working on the LOG scale, so we have to ADD these together
numerator <- function(value, data)  {
  # likelihood
  log_like <- MEAN_normal_loglike(data_vec = data, mean_value = value)
  # prior
  log_prior <- dnorm(x = value, mean = 40, sd = 10, log = TRUE)
  
  return(log_like + log_prior)
}

## function to calculate the acceptance ratio
M_accept_probability <- function(new_value, 
                               old_value, 
                               data_to_use) {
  
  # working on the LOG scale so we SUBTRACT values (the same as dividing these two things)
  new <- numerator(value = new_value, data = data_to_use)
  old <- numerator(value = old_value, data = data_to_use)
  
  difference_log_scale <- new - old
  
  # use EXP to undo the LOG -- convert back to probability
  r <- exp(difference_log_scale)
  
  p_accept <- min(1, r)
  
  return(p_accept)
}


```

Now that we've set up our functions, we use a for-loop to run the Markov chain:  

```{r}
# set tune parameter
tune_parameter <- 2
# how long should the chain be? 
n_samples <- 5000

#start chain
mean_chain <- numeric(n_samples)

# start value
mean_chain[1] <- 30

for (i in 2:length(mean_chain)) {
  
  old_val <- mean_chain[i - 1]
  
  new_val <- M_propose_new_val(old_value = old_val, tune = tune_parameter)
  
  p_accept <- M_accept_probability(new_value = new_val,
                                 old_value = old_val, 
                                 data_to_use = weights)
  
  mean_chain[i] <- ifelse(runif(1) < p_accept, new_val, old_val)
}

```

We can plot the chain iterations to get a first look at our results. This is called a "trace plot":  

```{r fig.cap="Trace plot of samples from one Metropolis algorithm"}
plot(mean_chain)
```

This shows the long road that our sampler takes to get from the starting value to the true mean. 
For this reason, typically we drop the beginning of the chain. 
These dropped samples are called the "burn in" period.  

```{r}
plot(mean_chain[100:n_samples], type = "l")
```

This shows the "fuzzy caterpillar" shape of a good, healthy Markov Chain.

```{r}
hist(mean_chain[100:n_samples])
abline(v = M_true_mean, col = "green", lwd = 5)
```

The green line shows the true average, which is close to the real value! 


### The weakness of Metropolis

Metropolis sampling will work, but sometimes we use MUCH more computer power than we need.
Let's see how many proposals are rejected in our sampling.

```{r fig.cap="Rejection in the Metropolis algorithm. here values of 0 mean that the sampler kept the same value. "}
rejects <- zapsmall(mean_chain[2:n_samples] - mean_chain[1:(n_samples - 1)] )
# 
plot(rejects)
# 
n_rejects <- sum(rejects == 0)  / n_samples
```

We rejected `r n_rejects*100`% of the values we tried. 
That's not very efficient! Soon we'll see a more efficient way to do this. 

## Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm -- asymmetrical jumps

_See the [slides on this part here](https://bios2.github.io/biodiversity_modelling_2021/slides/12_Bayes#49)_

The same, but we can use an asymmetrical proposal distribution.  This means that we can jump in either direction, but one direction is more likely.  We need this, because sometimes our parameters are bounded! For example, the standard deviation of a normal distribution can never be negative. 

Because our jumps are no longer symmetrical, we need to add a correction factor to our acceptance probability. Now, in addition to the Likelihood and Prior, we have the Candidate distribution getting involved:

$$
r = \frac{[y|\theta^{new}][\theta^{new}][\theta^{old}|\theta^{new}]}
{[y|\theta^{old}][\theta^{old}][\theta^{old}|\theta^{new}]}
$$ 

Here's the same expression, but with more words substituted as a guide:

$$
r = \frac{\text{Likelihood}(\text{data}|\theta^{new}) \times \text{Prior}(\theta^{new}, \alpha, \beta) \times \text{Candidate}(\theta^{old}, \mu = \theta^{new}, \sigma_{tune})}{\text{Likelihood}(\text{data}|\theta^{old}) \times \text{Prior}(\theta^{old}, \alpha, \beta)\times \text{Candidate}(\theta^{new}, \mu = \theta^{old}, \sigma_{tune})}
$$

once we have $r$, we can get the probability of acceptance, $R$, same as above (in the Metropolis algorithm):   

$$
R = \text{min}( 1, r)
$$

  
Let's go (back) to our Normal weights example and try this out.

<div class="blue">
**NOTE: We have to assume we KNOW the mean**. Later we'll see examples of what to do if you want to find two or more numbers at once! 
</div>

Our model will be:  
 
$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Normal}(50, \sigma) \\
\sigma &\sim \text{Gamma}\left(\frac{4^2}{3^2}, \frac{4}{3^2}\right)\\
\end{align}
$$
  
Why this weird notation for the gamma distribution?  
Here I'm using a classic trick called moment matching. 
We do this because for almost all distributions with two parameters, the mean and standard deviation each depend on both parameters. 
This means that each parameter is also a function of both the mean and the standard deviation. 
That means we can't directly set the mean and variance of a distribution with one parameter each.^[except for the Normal distribution. The Normal is a beautiful weirdo which is why we love it!]
  
Instead, we "reparameterize" the distribution, which just means we use values that correspond to the average and the standard deviation (or something like it). This is really helpful when you're using these distributions for ecology! 

for mean $\mu$ and standard devation $\sigma$, the Gamma distribution parameters are:  

$$
\text{Gamma}\left(\frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2}, \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2}\right)
$$

here's a quick demo to convince you:  

```{r}
rand_gammas <- rgamma(500, shape = 4^2/3^2, rate = 4/3^2)
hist(rand_gammas)
mean(rand_gammas) # close to 4
sd(rand_gammas) # close to 3
```

### Proposal distribution

We also need a distribution for the _proposals_ we will try in the algorithm. 
This distribution should be above 0, since we can't have a 0 variance. 
The lognormal is a good choice (and is hopefully clear since it is not the same distribution as the gamma)

What does $\text{lognormal}(2, 0.2)$ look like?

```{r}
hist(rlnorm(500, 2, .2))
```

### Code for Metropolis Hastings
Let's do Metropolis Hastings. We begin as before, with an expression for the numerator of Bayes Rule:

```{r}

## define likelihoods for our problem
MH_normal_loglike <- function(data_vec, sd_value){
  sum(dnorm(data_vec, mean = 50, sd = sd_value, log = TRUE))
}

######## ~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~~~~~#########
## NOTE that the mean gets logged as it goes into rlnorm and dlnorm!! 
## This is a very necessary detail 
## read the help files (?rlnorm) to find out what the R functions expect
######## ~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~~~~~#########

# proposal function to make new parameter values.
MH_propose_new_val <- function(old_value, sig_tune) {
  rlnorm(1, mean = log(old_value), sd = sig_tune)
}

MH_propose_density <- function(jump_to, jump_from, sig_tune) {
  dlnorm(x = jump_to, meanlog = log(jump_from), sdlog = sig_tune)
}


## function to use these to calculate the value of the numerator in Bayes Formula
## We are working on the LOG scale, so we have to ADD these together
MH_numerator <- function(v, data)  {
  # likelihood
  log_like <- MH_normal_loglike(data_vec = data, sd_value = v)
  # prior
  log_prior <- dgamma(x = v, shape = 4^2/3^2, rate = 4/3^2, log = TRUE)
  
  return(log_like + log_prior)
}

## function to calculate the acceptance ratio
MH_accept_probability <- function(new_value, old_value, 
                               data_to_use, 
                               tune_parameter) {
  
  # working on the LOG scale so we SUBTRACT values (the same as dividing these two things)
  new <- MH_numerator(v = new_value, data = data_to_use)
  old <- MH_numerator(v = old_value, data = data_to_use)
  
  difference_log_scale <- new - old
  
  # use EXP to undo the LOG
  r <- exp(difference_log_scale)
  
  # calculate the correction -- asymmetrical proposal
  new_from_old <- MH_propose_density(jump_to = new_value,
                                  jump_from = old_value,
                                  sig_tune = tune_parameter)
  
  old_from_new <- MH_propose_density(jump_to = old_value,
                                  jump_from = new_value,
                                  sig_tune = tune_parameter)
  
  R <- r * (old_from_new / new_from_old)
  
  p_accept <- min(1, R)
  
  return(p_accept)
}
```

The proposal distribution, centered on a value (e.g. $9$, to pick a random example) should be the same as the proposal density, centered on the same value.  

```{r fig.cap="Quick comparison of random proposals, compared to the output of the proposal density function. This shows that the proposal density function is just giving us the probability of different values for the next proposal."}

replicate(3000, MH_propose_new_val(9, 0.1)) %>% hist(probability = TRUE)
curve(MH_propose_density(jump_to = x, jump_from = 9, sig_tune = 0.1), xlim = c(5,14), add = TRUE)

```


```{r fig.cap="Metropolis Hastings chain for the posterior distribution of a standard deviation. Here we've dropped the burn-in period already. "}

# set tune parameter
tune_parameter <- .2
# how long should the chain be? 
n_samples <- 5000

#start chain
sd_chain <- numeric(n_samples)

# start value
sd_chain[1] <- 7

for (i in 2:length(sd_chain)) {
  
  old_val <- sd_chain[i - 1]
  
  new_val <- MH_propose_new_val(old_value = old_val, sig_tune = tune_parameter)
  
  p_accept <- MH_accept_probability(new_value = new_val,
                                 old_value = old_val, 
                                 data_to_use = weights,
                                 tune_parameter = tune_parameter)
  
  sd_chain[i] <- ifelse(runif(1) < p_accept, new_val, old_val)
}



plot(sd_chain[300:n_samples], type = "l")
```

```{r}

plot(density(sd_chain[300:n_samples]))
abline(v = correct_sd)
```

```{r}
median(sd_chain[300:n_samples])
mean(sd_chain[300:n_samples])
```

Close to the true value of `correct_sd` which is `r correct_sd`.

<div class = "blue">
PSA: I made **MANY** errors while I was writing the above. If I had not started with simulated data, I would never have known!! Each time, I compared my answer to `correct_sd` and then went looking for the errors. Please remember to always do this, especially when you are coding an algorithm yourself! 
</div>


<div class="blue">

Experiment with changing the proposal distribution! try for example gamma distribution:

```r
MH_propose_new_val <- function(old_value, sig_tune) {
  rgamma(1, shape = old_value^2/sig_tune^2, rate = old_value/sig_tune^2)
}

MH_propose_density <- function(jump_to, jump_from, sig_tune) {
  dgamma(x = jump_to, shape = jump_from^2/sig_tune^2, rate = jump_from/sig_tune^2)
}
```

</div>

## One Weird Trick to make calculating the posterior easy



### Mean of a Normal Distribution
  
model is something like
  
$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu, 3) \\
\mu &\sim \text{Normal(40, 10)}
\end{align}
$$

if the **variance is known**, the posterior for the mean is a Normal distribution:

$$
\mu' \sim \text{Normal}\left(\frac{\frac{m}{s}+ \frac{\sum{y}}{\sigma^2}}{\frac{1}{s^2} + \frac{n}{\sigma^2}}, \left(\frac{1}{s^2} + \frac{n}{\sigma^2}\right)\right)
$$

Note that $m$ is the prior mean and $s$ is the prior variance. This is the prior on the parameter $\mu$, the mean of the distribution of the observations.


```{r fig.cap="The Posterior distribution of the mean of a normal distribution. Here we find it two ways: first, using the conjugate prior. Second, using the Metropolis algorithm. You can see that the two are a close match."}

posterior_mean_calculate <- function(y_vector, known_sigma,
                      prior_mean, prior_sd,
                      n = length(y_vector)){
  numerator_mean <- (prior_mean/prior_sd^2 + sum(y_vector) / known_sigma^2)
  denominator_mean <- (1 / prior_sd^2 + n / known_sigma^2)
  
  new_mean <-  numerator_mean / denominator_mean
    
  new_var <- 1/denominator_mean
  
  return(list(mean = new_mean, sd = sqrt(new_var)))
}


## calculate the posterior distribution of the mean for the weights data
posterior_parameters <- posterior_mean_calculate(weights, 3, 
                                                 prior_mean = 30, 
                                                 prior_sd = 10)

hist(mean_chain[300:n_samples], probability = TRUE)
curve(dnorm(x, 
            mean = posterior_parameters$mean, 
            sd = posterior_parameters$sd), add = TRUE)
```


### Variance of the Normal Distribution

First we need to do a little math tweak to the model:

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Normal}(50, \sigma) \\
\frac{1}{\sigma^2} &\sim \text{Gamma}\left(\frac{4^2}{3^2}, \frac{4}{3^2}\right)\\
\end{align}
$$

Now instead of setting the prior on $\sigma$ directly, we set the prior on the _inverse square_ of sigma!^[Why do we do the inverse square? Well, the square of the standard deviation is the variance. As we know, the larger the variance, the wider the distribution. The inverse variance has the opposite interpretation: the larger it is, the more narrow and focussed the distribution! This is called the "precision", and it is another common way to think about the Normal Distribution.]

We can think of this as a kind of link function. Doing a bit of algebra, we can see that:

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Normal}(50, g^{-1/2}) \\
g &\sim \text{Gamma}\left(\frac{4^2}{3^2}, \frac{4}{3^2}\right)\\
\end{align}
$$

I admit that this makes setting reasonable priors awkward, so let's go back to plotting:

```{r}
gs <- rgamma(5000, 3.5^2/3^2, 3.5/3^2)

plot(density(gs^-.5))
```

if the mean is known, then the posterior distribution for the variance is an inverse gamma:

$$
\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sim \text{Gamma}\left(\alpha + \frac{n}{2}, 
\beta + \frac{\sum (y_i - \mu)^2}{2}\right)
$$


Another, way less bothersome way to write this is with a related distribution, called the Inverse Gamma:  

$$
\sigma^2 \sim \text{InvGamma}\left(\alpha + \frac{n}{2}, 
\beta + \frac{\sum (y_i - \mu)^2}{2}\right)
$$

You can convert both precision and varience to the standard deviation with some algebra. 

```{r}
precision_values <- seq(0.09, .15, length.out = 3000)
post_density <- dgamma(precision_values, 2^2/50^2 + length(weights)/2, 2/5^2 + sum((weights - 50)^2)/2)

plot(x = precision_values^-.5, y = post_density, xlim = c(2.5,3.5))

(precision_values^-.5)[which.max(post_density)]
abline(v = correct_sd)
```

equivalently:

```{r}

variance_values <- seq(2.5, 10.5, length.out = 3000)
post_density_invgamma <- extraDistr::dinvgamma(variance_values,
                                alpha = 2^2/50^2 + length(weights)/2, 
                                beta = 2/5^2 + sum((weights - 50)^2)/2)

plot(x = sqrt(variance_values), y = post_density_invgamma, xlim = c(2.5,3.5))

```


```{r}

posterior_sds <- tibble(sigma = seq(from = 2.6,
                                    to = 11,
                                    length.out = 500),

                                                        beta = (2/5^2 + sum((weights - 50)^2)/2)))

)
```

Gibbs sampling is like knitting. Imagine you have several parameters and you're going to take posterior samples for each one. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
vals <- expand_grid(y = 5:1, x = 1:3)

pnames <- c("beta[0]", "beta[1]", "sigma")

vals <- mutate(vals, 
               par = pnames[x])

out_list <- map(3:nrow(vals), ~ transform(vals, s = rep(c(1,0), times = c(.x, nrow(vals)-.x))))

names(out_list) <- stringr::str_pad(1:length(out_list), width = 2, pad = "0")

library(gganimate)
p <- out_list %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "sim") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, width = 1, height = 1, fill = s, label = par)) + 
  geom_tile(col = "black", lwd = 2) + 
  geom_text(parse = TRUE) + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  theme_void() + 
  transition_states(sim,  transition_length = 0, state_length = 1)

anim_save("param_knit.gif", animate(p, nframes = 15))
```

![](param_knit.gif)

In this simple animation, each column is a parameter and each row is an iteration of the model. 

Gibbs sampling works by simplifying a multivariate problem into small steps and tackling each one. We consider that all the parameters are known except the one we are sampling right now. Then, we sample form the posterior distribution for that parameter. This sampling can be done by conjugate posteriors, as we did above. It can also be done with the Metropolis or Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, or even with a combination of the two!

The steps for this algorithm are similar to the previous ones:

1. Start with random values for each parameter.
1. assuming that all are correct except the first, sample a value for the first.
1. Assuming that sample was correct for the first, sample the second. 

### Gibbs demo with the Normal Distribution

Let's begin by simulating some values from a normal distribution:

```{r }
true_mean <- 31
true_sd <-  4
sample_size <- 30
set.seed(1859)
mass_values <- rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = true_mean, sd = true_sd)

hist(mass_values)
```

We define a model for these data. 
We do this in a very deliberate way, choosing the priors to be conjugates:

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma) \\
\mu &\sim \text{Normal}(10,5) \\
\frac{1}{\sigma^2} &\sim \text{Gamma}(4.1^2/2^2, 4.1/2^2)
\end{align}
$$

Why did I choose the mean of 4.5 for the gamma distribution? 
What is a gamma distribution anyway, and what does this strange link function mean? 

As usual, simulation is a great way to understand and practice. 

Let's start by simulating values with a mean of 

```{r}

rg <- rgamma(1000, shape = 4.1^2/2^2, rate = 4.1/2^2)
mean(rg)
sd(rg)

curve(dgamma(x, shape = 3^2/2^2, rate = 3/2^2), xlim = c(0, 5))

plot(density(1/rg^.5))
```

### Defining and running a Gibbs Sampler

To implement this model we need to write functions that will do each of these things in turn.

```{r}
# calculate the posterior normal distribution for the data and a known variance

post_mean <- function(y_vector, known_sigma,
                      prior_mean, prior_sd,
                      n = length(y_vector)){
  numerator_mean <- (prior_mean/prior_sd^2 + sum(y_vector) / known_sigma^2)
  denominator_mean <- (1 / prior_sd^2 + n / known_sigma^2)
  
  new_mean <-  numerator_mean / denominator_mean
    
  new_var <- 1/denominator_mean
  
  rnorm(1, mean = new_mean, sd = sqrt(new_var))
}

# fun to play with this! make sure it makes sense! 
post_mean(y_vector = c(2,4,1,5), .1, 7, 2)

```

```{r}
post_sd <- function(y_vector, known_mean, prior_alpha, prior_beta){
  
  new_alpha <- prior_alpha + length(y_vector) / 2
  
  new_beta <- prior_beta + sum((y_vector - known_mean)^2) / 2
  
  inverse_variance <- rgamma(n = 1, shape = new_alpha, rate = new_beta)
  
  sd_sample <- sqrt(1/inverse_variance)
  return(sd_sample)
}

post_sd(c(2,4,1,5), known_mean = 3, prior_alpha = 2^2/2^2, prior_beta = 2/2^2)

sd(c(2,4,1,5))
```

```{r}
true_mean <- 24
true_sd <- 7

y_data <- rnorm(400, mean = true_mean, sd = true_sd)

# gibbs process
n_iterations <- 2000
mean_chain <- numeric(n_iterations)
sd_chain <- numeric(n_iterations)


# sample to start -- could be anything, might as well be priors
mean_chain[1] <- rnorm(1, mean = 10, sd = 5)
sd_chain[1] <- rgamma(1, shape = 3^2/2^2, rate = 3/2^2)

for (k in 2:n_iterations) {
  # draw a mean
  mean_chain[k] <- post_mean(y_vector = y_data,
                             known_sigma = sd_chain[k - 1],
                             prior_mean = 10,
                             prior_sd = 5)
  sd_chain[k] <- post_sd(y_vector = y_data, 
                         known_mean = mean_chain[k],
                         prior_alpha = 3^2/2^2,
                         prior_beta = 3/2^2)
}

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(mean_chain)
abline(h = true_mean, col = "red", lwd = 2)
plot(sd_chain)
abline(h = true_sd, col = "red", lwd = 2)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

You can see that the chains are almost exactly what we want.

```{r}
curve(dnorm(x, mean = true_mean, sd = true_sd),
      xlim = c(true_mean - 4 * true_sd,
               true_mean + 4 * true_sd), 
      lwd = 8, col = "red", ylim = c(0, 0.07))

for (i in (n_iterations-10):n_iterations) {
  curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean_chain[i], sd = sd_chain[i]), add = TRUE, lty = 2)
}
```

Are the posterior medians close to the real values?

```{r}
median(mean_chain[100:n_iterations])
true_mean

median(sd_chain[100:n_iterations])
true_sd
```

Play with these values and see if you can break this algorithm.

We can also look at the pairs plot, like this

```{r}
plot(mean_chain[100:n_iterations], sd_chain[100:n_iterations])
```

This reveals if there are any correlations in the posterior. 

## Metropolis-in-Gibbs

Sometimes we need a Deluxe option -- running a Metropolis Hastings sampler inside a Gibbs sampler

Let's look at an example where that is necessary

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{LogNormal}(\text{log}) \\
\end{align}
$$

```{r}

truemean <- 15
truesd <- 3


ff <- rlnorm(2000,
             meanlog = log(truemean) - .5*log((truemean^2 + truesd^2)/truemean^2), 
             sdlog = log((truemean^2 + truesd^2)/truemean^2)^.5)

mean(ff)

sd(ff)

hist(ff)
```

conjugacy and the lognormal

```{r}
# mean 2 sd = 3
curve(dnorm(x, 
            mean = (2/20^2 + sum(log(ff))/truesd^2)/(1/20^2 + length(ff)/truesd^2),
            sd = (1/20^2 + length(ff)/truesd^2)^-1),
      xlim = c(1, 10)
)
abline(v = log(truemean))
```

```{r}
curve(dgamma(x, 
             shape = 3 + length(ff)/2,
             rate = 4 + sum( (log(ff) - truemean )^2) / 2), xlim = c(0,.01))

(1/truesd^2)


```

```{r}

ml <- log(truemean) - .5*log((truemean^2 + truesd^2)/truemean^2)

curve(dgamma(x, 
             shape = 3 + length(ff)/2,
             rate = 4 + sum( (log(ff) - ml )^2) / 2), xlim = c(0,40))

abline(v = 1/log((truemean^2 + truesd^2)/truemean^2))


```


```{r}

truemean <- 15
truesd <- 3
sig <- .6

ff <- rlnorm(2000,
             meanlog = log(truemean), 
             sdlog = sig)

ff %>% median

sd(ff)

curve(extraDistr::dinvgamma(x, 
                            alpha = 3 + length(ff)/2,
                            beta = 4 + sum( (log(ff) - log(truemean))^2 ) / 2),
      xlim = c(0,3)
      # add = TRUE
)
abline(v = sig^2)


```



```{r}
curve(extraDistr::dinvgamma(x, 
                            alpha = 3,
                            beta = 4), xlim = c(0, 3))
abline(v = truesd^2)
```




```{r}
curve(4 * x ^ (.2), xlim = c(1,300))
```

* some kind of decerating power curve
* one of the parameters is probably less than 1 but not less than 0

```{r}
true_sd <- 4
true_value_at_one <-  2
true_exponent <- .5
library(tibble)

energy_mass <- tibble(
  masses = runif(n = 200, min = 2, max = 320),
  avg_energy = true_value_at_one*masses^true_exponent,
  energies = rlnorm(200,
                    meanlog = log(avg_energy) - .5*log((avg_energy^2 + true_sd^2)/avg_energy^2), 
                    sdlog = log((avg_energy^2 + true_sd^2)/avg_energy^2)^.5))

library(ggplot2)

energy_mass %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = masses, y = energies)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}

```

## Conjugate priors, Metropolis-Hastings, and Penguins


### Proof of Beta & Binomial conjugate pair


$$
\begin{align}
[p|\text{trials}, \text{successes}, \alpha, \beta] &\propto [\text{successes} | \text{trials}, p] \times [p | \alpha , \beta]\\
&\propto \text{Binomial}(p,\text{trials}) \times \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)\\
&\propto{\text{trials} \choose \text{successes}}p^\text{successes}(1-p)^{\text{trials}-\text{successes}} \times \text{B} p^{\alpha - 1}(1-p)^{\beta - 1}\\
&\propto p^\text{successes}(1-p)^{\text{trials}-\text{successes}} \times p^{\alpha - 1}(1-p)^{\beta - 1}\\
&\propto p^{\alpha + \text{successes} - 1}(1-p)^{ \beta + \text{trials}-\text{successes} - 1}
\end{align}
$$

Now we only have to realize that the last line is a beta distribution, without the magic number that we called "$B$" before. 
This value is what's called a "normalizing constant". 
Normalizing constants make the proportional expression (like the one above) into a probability distribution 

<aside> remember that probability distributions sum to 1. So we just need to divide by some magic number that makes the whole thing, whatever it is, sum to 1. That magic number is our normalizing constant </aside>

$$
[p|\text{trials}, \text{successes}, \alpha, \beta] = \text{Beta}(\alpha + \text{successes} - 1, \beta + \text{trials}-\text{successes} - 1)
$$

So the posterior distribution is a Beta distribution, just like the prior was! We have it already, with no need for any fancy sampling approach. 

This also gives us an easy interpretation of what the parameters of any Beta distribution are: $\alpha$ is something like the number of successes, and $\beta$ is something like the number of failures^[Not EXACTLY successes and failures because $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be decimal numbers (e.g. "1.5") and obviously real successes and failures can't be. You can think of these as "pseudosuccesses" and "pseudofailures" or, as I prefer, "successosity" and "failishness" ].


Suppose we had written the model like this:

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Binomial}(p, N) \\
\text{logit}(p)  &= \alpha\\ 
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(1, 1)
\end{align}
$$

Remember that the binomial distribution is written as:

$$
{n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

the two lines in equation 1 are just a shorthand for saying "replace $p$ with the inverse logit of $\alpha$". 
We could also write it this way, literally replacing $p$ with that function

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim {n \choose k} \left(\frac{e^\alpha}{1 + e^\alpha} \right)^{k}\left(1-\frac{e^\alpha}{1 + e^\alpha}\right)^{n-k} \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(1, 1)
\end{align}
$$

Another quick reminder, remember that the logistic function is a traditional way of squishing any real number into the interval $(0,1)$:

$$
\frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}
$$

```{r}
curve(exp(x)/(1 + exp(x)),
      xlim = c(-4, 4), ylim = c(0, 1))
```




Let's imagine an experiment where we place exactly 42 seeds in experimental plots. We use 30 experimental plots.

We want to estimate a probability of germination for these seedlings

Our model looks like this:

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Binomial}(p_{\text{survival}}, 42)\\
p_{\text{survival}} &\sim \text{Beta}(2,5)\\
\end{align}
$$

in English, this means:

* We thing that the number of seedlings which germinate will follow a Binomial distribution. This means that out of a total of 42, some survive. The probability for any surviving is the same: $p_{\text{survival}}$
* 


```{r}
## start with some survival data -- out of 42
true_prob <- 0.7

set.seed(1859)
n_surviving <- rbinom(n = 300, size = 42, prob = true_prob)

hist(n_surviving, xlim = c(0, 42))
```

Can use the conjugate posterior.

First, use the conjugate prior to the binomial (beta distribution).

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, 2,5))
```

This might be a reasonable first guess. But what does it actually mean? we need to do predictions to make sure.

```{r}
possible_probabilities <- rbeta(300, 2, 5)

hist(rbinom(30, 42, possible_probabilities), xlim = c(0, 42))

```
Do this a bunch of times, to see if the prior is foolish or not.

With enough data, even an outlandish prior is fine: 

```{r}
lived <- sum(n_surviving)
died <- sum(42 - n_surviving)
```

calculate the posterior

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, 2, 5),ylim = c(0,4))
curve(dbeta(x, 2 + lived, 5 + died), add = TRUE, lty = 2)
abline(v = true_prob)

abline(v =(2 + lived)/(2 + lived + 5 + died), col = "red")
```


### Sampling this model: the Metropolis algorithm

Once again, our model is:

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim \text{Binomial}(p, N) \\
\text{logit}(p)  &= \alpha\\ 
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(1, 1)
\end{align}
$$

Now we have no conjugate posterior for $\alpha$.
However, just because we can't calculate the distribution doesn't mean we can't sample it!

We can use the Metropolis algorithm.

```{r}

## define likelihoods for our problem
binomial_loglike <- function(data_vec, prob_new){
  sum(dbinom(data_vec, size = 42, 
             prob = prob_new, log = TRUE))
}

normal_loglike <- function(val, mean_prior, sd_prior){
  dnorm(val, mean = mean_prior, sd = sd_prior, log = TRUE)
}


# define our function
logistic_curve <- function(x) exp(x)/(1 + exp(x))

## function to use these to calculate the value of the numerator in Bayes Formula
numerator <- function(v, data)  {
  binomial_loglike(data_vec = data, prob_new = logistic_curve(v)) + 
    normal_loglike(val = v, mean = -1, sd = 2)
}

## function to calculate the acceptance ratio
accept_probability <- function(new_value, old_value, data_to_use) {
  r <- exp(numerator(v = new_value, data = data_to_use) - 
        numerator(v = old_value, data = data_to_use))
  
  p_accept <- min(1, r)
  
  return(p_accept)
}

# proposal function to make new parameter values.
propose_new <- function(x, sig_tune) rnorm(1, mean = x, sd = sig_tune)

# start value
metropolis <- function(dataset,
                       n_samples,
                       tune_parameter,
                       start_value){
  chain <- numeric(n_samples)
  
  chain[1] <- start_value
  
  for (i in 2:length(chain)) {
    
    old <- chain[i - 1]
    
    new <- propose_new(old, sig_tune = tune_parameter)
    
    p_accept <- accept_probability(new_value = new,
                                   old_value = old, 
                                   data_to_use = dataset)
    
    chain[i] <- ifelse(runif(1) < p_accept, new, old)
  }
  return(chain)
}


chain <- metropolis(dataset = n_surviving,
                    n_samples = 3000,
                    tune_parameter = 0.2, 
                    start_value = 0)

plot(chain[300:3000], type = "l")
```

```{r}
hist(chain[300:5000])
```


```{r}
hist(plogis(chain[200:5000]), xlim = c(0.6,.9), probability = TRUE)
abline(v = true_prob)

curve(dbeta(x, 2 + lived, 5 + died), add = TRUE, lty = 2)
```


### Application: Clutch success in the Palmer Penguins

```{r}
pr <- read.csv(path_to_file("penguins_raw.csv"))
penguins_raw %>% 
  count(Species, `Clutch Completion`) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = `Clutch Completion`, values_from = n) %>% 
  knitr::kable(.)
```

With this, we can calculate the posterior probability of clutch success for each penguin species. 

$$
\begin{align}
n_{\text{succeeded}} &\sim \text{Binomial}(p_{\text{success}}, n_{\text{nesting}})\\
p_{\text{success}} &\sim \text{Beta}(7,3)\\
\end{align}
$$

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, 7, 3), ylim = c(0, 17))
curve(dbeta(x, 138 + 7, 14 + 3), add = TRUE, lty = 2)
curve(dbeta(x, 54 + 7, 14 + 3), add = TRUE, lty = 3)
curve(dbeta(x, 116 + 7, 8 + 3), add = TRUE, lty = 4)
legend(0,17, legend = c("prior", "Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo"), lty = 1:4)
```



## Three parameters at once

Imagine that you are doing a simple linear regression and you want to get three parameters: the slope, the intercept, and the variance of the observations.

We perform the same procedure, looking for gibbs samples where we can. 

<tk write model definiton>
<tk use DAGS to draw the models?>

```{r}
n_invented <- 300
x_invented <- runif(n = n_invented, -2, 2) 

true_intercept <- 50
true_slope <- 2

true_observation_sd <- 1.5

y_invented <- rnorm(n = n_invented, 
                    mean = true_intercept + true_slope*x_invented, 
                    sd = true_observation_sd)

plot(x_invented, y_invented)
```

```{r}
# gibbs process
n_iterations <- 2000
b0_chain <- numeric(n_iterations)
b1_chain <- numeric(n_iterations)
observation_sd_chain <- numeric(n_iterations)


# sample to start -- could be anything, might as well be priors
b0_chain[1] <- rnorm(1, mean = 10, sd = 5)
b1_chain[1] <- rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 2)
observation_sd_chain[1] <- rgamma(1, shape = 3^2/2^2, rate = 3/2^2)

for (k in 2:n_iterations) {
  # draw a mean
  b0_chain[k] <- post_mean(
    y_vector = y_invented - x_invented * b1_chain[k - 1],
    known_sigma = observation_sd_chain[k - 1],
    prior_mean = 10,
    prior_sd = 5)
  b1_chain[k] <- post_mean(
    y_vector = (y_invented - b0_chain[k])*x_invented,
    known_sigma = observation_sd_chain[k - 1],
    prior_mean = 0,
    prior_sd = 2, 
    n = sum(x_invented^2))
  observation_sd_chain[k] <- post_sd(
    y_vector = y_invented, 
    known_mean = b0_chain[k] + x_invented * b1_chain[k],
    prior_alpha = 3^2/2^2,
    prior_beta = 3/2^2)
}

par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(b0_chain[100:n_iterations])
abline(h = true_intercept, col = "red", lwd = 2)
plot(b1_chain[100:n_iterations])
abline(h = true_slope, col = "red", lwd = 2)
plot(observation_sd_chain[100:n_iterations])
abline(h = true_observation_sd, col = "red", lwd = 2)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

```{r}
# plot these regression lines

plot(x_invented, y_invented)

for (k in 200:220){
  abline(a = b0_chain[k], b = b1_chain[k])
}
```

could also plot some interesting posterior predictive plots in this way.

## Metropolis hastings and gibbs at the same time

Sometimes you will have a model for which you can't (or don't want to) use conjugate posteriors for each of the conditional distributions.
